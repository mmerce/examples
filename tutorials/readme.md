# WhizzML Tutorials

This folder contains some basic scripts that are mainly written to provide
simple examples of utilities that can be done using WhizzML. The examples
are provided to illustrate how to build simple functions that can be combined
to perform usual chores.

Besides those examples, the `docs` folder contains `101's` commented examples
that describe the steps needed to create canonical training and predicting
workflows. Each `101` deals with a different model type:

- [101_anomaly](./docs/101_anomaly.md)
- [101_association](./docs/101_association.md)
- [101_cluster](./docs/101_cluster.md)
- [101_deepnet](./docs/101_deepnet.md)
- [101_ensemble](./docs/101_ensemble.md)
- [101_fusion](./docs/101_fusion.md)
- [101_images_classification](./docs/101_images_classification.md)
- [101_images_feature_extraction](./docs/101_images_feature_extraction.md)
- [101_linear_regression](./docs/101_linear_regression.md)
- [101_logistic_regression](./docs/101_logistic_regression.md)
- [101_model](./docs/101_model.md)
- [101_optiml](./docs/101_optiml.md)
- [101_pca](./docs/101_pca.md)
- [101_scripting](./docs/101_scripting.md)
- [101_topic_model](./docs/101_topic_model.md)
- [101_ts](./docs/101_ts.md)

Most of these documents focus on the creation calls for all BigML resources
using default parameters. Of course, they can be modified to add other
tuning parameters in each creation call. To learn more about the available
parameter, please check the [API documentation](https://bigml.com/api/).
