WhizzML: 101 - Using a Time Series
==================================

Following the schema described in the prediction workflow
document, this is the code snippet that shows the minimal workflow to
create a time series and produce a forecast.

.. code-block::

    ;; step 0: creating a source from the data in your remote "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigmlcom/python/master/data/grades.csv" file
    (define source-id (create-source {"remote" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigmlcom/python/master/data/grades.csv"}))
    (log-info "Creating remote source: " source-id)
    ;; step 1: creating a dataset from the previously created `source`
    (define dataset-id (create-dataset source-id))
    (log-info "Creating dataset from source: " dataset-id)
    ;; step 2: creating a time series
    (define timeseries-id (create-timeseries dataset-id))
    (log-info "Creating time series from dataset: " timeseries-id)
    ;; the new input data to forecast
    (define input-data {"000005" {"horizon" 10}})
    ;; creating the forecast
    (define forecast-id (create-forecast timeseries-id
                                         {"input_data" input-data}))
    (log-info "Creating forecast for some input data: " forecast-id)
    ;; the forecast resource contains a property where it stores
    ;; the forecast value.
    (define forecast-resource (fetch forecast-id))
    ;; extracting the forecast value from the resource
    (define forecast (forecast-resource ["forecast" "result"]))
    (log-info "The forecast for " input-data " is : " forecast)

You can test this code in the `WhizzML REPL <https://bigml.com/labs/repl/>`_.

To learn more about the arguments that can be set in the `forecast` and
`timeseries` creation calls and the response properties, please have a look
at the `API documentation <https://bigml.com/api/>`_
