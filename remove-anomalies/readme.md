# Removing anomalous rows from a giving dataset

This is a simple script that, given an input dataset, creates an
anomaly detector and uses it to identify its top anomalous rows,
proceeding then to create a new dataset without them using a Flatline
filter. The filter can exclude a number of anomalies or set a score threshold.
