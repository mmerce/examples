  "name": "Linear regression's k-fold cross-validation",
  "description": "The objective of this script is to perform a k-fold cross validation of a\n linear regression built from a dataset. The algorithm:\n\n - Divides the dataset in k parts\n - Holds out the data in one of the parts and builds a linear regression\n with the rest of data\n - Evaluates the linear regression with the hold out data\n - The second and third steps are repeated with each of the k parts, so that\n k evaluations are generated\n - Finally, the evaluation metrics are averaged to provide the cross-validation\n metrics.\n\n The **output** of the script will be an `evaluation ID`. This evaluation is a\n cross-validation, meaning that its metrics are averages of the k evaluations\n created in the cross-validation process.\n\n For more information, please see the [readme](https://github.com/whizzml/examples/tree/master/cross-validation/linear-regression).",
